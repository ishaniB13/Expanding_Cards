        <br>The only way to experience Kolkata is to feel the city, live the city. And that is as good as living in a kaleidoscope. It is known as the cultural capital of India and home to the Bengal Renaissance, Kolkata continues to spawn generations
        of poets, writers and film directors. Kolkata stirs up everyone's emotions, it stirs up their soul. The city at dusk through the heavy dark thunder clouds, the incessant noise from the crowded streets, the familiar and the unfamiliar faces, the
        multiple options of local savouries, the hurtling riot of colours – these rejuvenate people. Calcutta, now Kolkata, has many stories to tell. It is a city seeped in history, where the old and the new, the past and the present, come together in
        unexpected ways and create a vibrant culture that manifests itself in the city’s many passions— theatre, art, politics, football and food.
